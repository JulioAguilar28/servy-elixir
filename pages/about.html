<h1>Clark's Wildthings Refuge</h1>

<blockquote>
  When we contemplate the whole globe as one great dewdrop, striped and dotted
  with cotinents and islands, flying through space with other stars and singing
  and shining together as one, the whole universe as an infinite storm of beaut.
  -- John Muir
